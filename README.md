# rock-paper-scissors
This is my first js project to create a rock paper scissor game. 

At this stage, it works by playing 5 rounds of rock paper scissors through 
a prompt message displayed on the browsers. The result of the of each round
will be displayed on the console of the website. If either player or cpu
reach 3 wins before the end of the 5 rounds, the leader would be declared
the winner of the game.

The code randomize the cpu choice of rock paper scissors by including them
in an array of 3 strings. The string get picked up randomly by using Math.random function to pick a number between 0 and 2 to select from the array.

The player picks their choice of rock paper scissors afterwards and the result would be shown in the console log.
